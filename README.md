# TODO app

This is the TODO app sample that is used in the Angular Webinar. It has one branch per step we did on the Webinar. The video will be available soon.

The steps shows how to easily move from an open TODO app where everybody sees and edits everybody's tasks to a TODO app per user where only you can see your tasks.

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
1. run npm install -g serve
1. run serve in the directory of this project.

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll see the app running :).
